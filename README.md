# Mozart: A Generative Art Platform

Mozart is a machine learning art platform that generates art from text prompts, transfer style to images to make them artistic, and increase the resolution of pictures, all built into a single web-app, presently using Gradio 3.0.

* [Latent Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) for generating art from text prompts.
* [Neural Style Transfer](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer) for transferring an image's style onto another image.
* [Torch-SRGAN](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/torch-srgan) for Super-Resolution.
