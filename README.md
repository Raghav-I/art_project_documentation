# Mozart: An AI Art Platform

Mozart is a machine learning art platform that generates art via text prompts, transfer style on images to make them look artistic, and increase the resolution of pictures, all built into a single web-app, presently using Gradio 3.0.

* [Neural Style Transfer](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer) for transferring an image's style into another image.
* [VQGAN+CLIP](https://github.com/mfrashad/text2art) for generating art from text prompts.
* [Torch-SRGAN](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/torch-srgan) for super resolution.
